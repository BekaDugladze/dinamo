                    <p>The history of FC Dinamo Tbilisi begun from the autumn of 1925. Management of the sports society of Dinamo set out to form football club. In those days football was gradually becoming one of the most popular sports in the world.
                    <br></br>
                    In 1927 FC Dinamo Tbilisi established Juniors club "Norchi Dinamoeli" (young Dinamo). The club provided FC Dinamo Tbilisi with young skillful players. Numerous talented players graduated from the youngsters club, among them was the first goalkeeper who played for Dinamo in the USSR championship. The first captain - Shota Savgulidze, defender - Mikhail Minaev, forward - Vladimer Berdzenishvili and other famous players.
                    <br></br>
                    In early years in Georgia there was no official championships held, so the teams was playing friendly games amongst each other. The first match was played with Azerbaijan team Dinamo Baku on 26 January 1926. More experienced Azerbaijan squad won the match 1:0.
                    <br></br>

                    After 3 days Dinamo played against another Azerbaijan team, "Progress" and easily beat them 3:0. Despite the fact that in the middle years of 30s the physical preparation and skills of the Georgian players were perfect, the football federation of the Soviet Union placed FC Dinamo Tbilisi in the first league instead of superior one. Dinamo emerged as a winner in the match against, probably the best team in the USSR championship, Dinamo Moscow, score 9:5 in Tbilisi. Afterwards they beat Dinamo Leningrad 3:2.
                    <br></br>
                    The fact that Dinamo Tbilisi was not appreciated by the management of the Soviet Union football federation was clear. In the matches of first league Dinamo won 5 matches out of 6. And played draw against Stalinec Moscow.This was enough for Dinamo to qualify in the superior league.</p>

Since 1983 crisis began in the history of Dinamo Tbilisi. It was hard for the club to qualify from the first rounds of the Soviet Cup. Bad performance in championship. From 1983 to1989 team appered only once on the UEFA tournaments.
<br></br>

                    <p>90s. In 1990 Georgian Football Federation refuses to participate in Soviet Union championship. That mean that no Georgian Football Clubs would appear on Soviet tournaments. From that very moment newest history of FC Dinamo Tbilisi started.
<br></br>
The most titled football club in Georgia played its first match in Georgian National championship against Kolkheti Poti on 30 March of 1990. Surprisingly Dinamo loses the historical match with the score 0:1. In spite of the bad luck in the first round Dinamo proved its strength and appeared the winner of the first Georgian National championship. Club kept the title of the champion throughout the next 9 championships. First time club won the Georgian Cup in 1992. They beat Tskhumi Sokhumi in the final game.
<br></br>
In 1993 Dinamo makes double, became winner of Georgian Championship and Georgian Cup simultaneousely. Although, this was a great challenge, more important fact occurred in 1993. Dinamo played its first international official match representing independent Georgia. Dinamo won home match against Linfield (N.Ireland) 2:1 with goals of S.Arveladze and G.Inalishvili. The second leg in Belfast ended 1:1. Unfortunately Dinamo did not qualify to the next round. The club was suspended for two years from UEFA tournaments.
<br></br>
FC Dinamo Tbilisi continued to win Georgian championships and Georgian cup, but there was no luck on European tournaments.
<br></br>
In 1996 Dinamo qualified in 3 rounds of UEFA Cup. They beat Grevenmahcer (Luxemburg) 4:0 - 2:2, Molde (Norway) 2:1 - 0:0 and Torpedo (Russia) 1:0 - 1:1. Unfortunately club was not able to overcome Portuguese Boavista and left the tournament. This was the best result in Dinamo Tbilisi recent history (1990-2001). Later, the migration of the key players to Western European clubs caused negative results. It became harder and harder for the club to win Georgian Championship or Georgian Cup.

But Dinamo loses in these four matches.
<br></br>
In next season Dinamo becomes the Champion. For the last time our team becomes a winner of Georgian Championship in 2008, when the head coach of Dinamo is Czech specialist, Dusan Uhrin.
<br></br>
In 2009 the club beats FC Olimpi and becomes the owner of Georgian Cup.
